### Hello, I'm Waylon ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Mastersâ€™s candidate studying computer science at Colorado State University. After completing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, I was employed as a cybersecurity intern by the academic computing and networking services at CSU. I quickly developed a deep passion for cybersecurity and computer science and decided to go back to school to learn more.

While studying for my masterâ€™s, I have been employed as a Junior Systems Administrator for the Computer Science department, managing over 600 Unix machines. This summer, I am also working for Hedera Hashgraph as a developer advocate intern providing educational content on leveraging the Hashgraph distributed network.

I love python, Linux, rust, and cryptography. If you share any of these interests, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to sharing my technical experiences with all of you hear and learn from the community. Thanks for reading :)
