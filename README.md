### Hello, I'm 0xJepsen

I‚Äôm a computer scientist passionate about high impact technology. My research interests lay at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. I value work ethic and tenacity above all else.

- üè¶ I‚Äôm currently working on building financial derivatives from [RMMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14769.pdf).
- ü™∑ I grew up off-the-grid in a Tibetan Budhist community for the first 13 years of my life. The lineage was the [Nyingma](https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Nyingma) school of thought. 

## Education

- üö¥ [Cyclic Redundancy Checks and Error Detection](https://github.com/0xJepsen/CRC_Research/blob/master/Cyclic_Redundancy_Checks_and_Error_Detection.pdf)

**Abstract**: This study investigates the capabilities of Cyclic Redundancy \\ Checks(CRCs) to detect burst and random errors. Researchers have favored these error detection codes throughout the evolution of computing and have implemented them in communication protocols worldwide. CRCs are integrated into almost every device, in software and hardware. CRCs play a critical role in ensuring that our digital communication systems are efficient and erroneous packets are detected. Because the quantity of data generated and transmitted has increased over the last twenty years, we are more likely to encounter errors. It is important that the tools and methodologies used to ensure the integrity of digital communication systems are evaluated to handle higher frequencies of information. In this study, we explore the need to improve the capabilities of error-detecting codes to handle higher quantities of data by testing the error detection properties of CRC's in a restricted domain.

**Tropical Algebra**
Max-Plus tropical algebra is the semi-ring structure over real numbers with operations $\oplus$ an $\otimes$ where the $\oplus$ operator performs the max operation such that $x\oplus y = max(x,y)$, and the $\otimes$ operator is the traditional addition operation such that $x \otimes y = x+y$ where $x,y \in \mathbb{R} \cup \{- \infty \}$.  More concretely think of the addition operator being replaced by the maximum operator and the multiplication operator being replaced by traditional addition. The zero element for $\otimes$ is $\varepsilon \equiv -\infty$. Since the max-plus algebra is a semi ring there does not exist an inverse element for $\oplus$. Let $ R_{max} = R \cup \{- \infty \}$, and let ${R_{max}^{d,d}, \oplus, \otimes\}$ define the set of square matrices in this algebra of dimension $d \times d$. Extending the algebra to matrices we can define linear algebra in terms of $\oplus$ and $\otimes$. If $A,B\in R_{max}^{m\times n}$, then $A \oplus B_{i,j}$ = $a_{i,j} \oplus b_{i,j}$ and $A\otimes B_{ij} = \bigoplus_{1\leq k \leq d} A_{ik} \otimes B_{kj} = max_{1 \leq k \leq d}(a_{ik} \otimes b_{kj})$
