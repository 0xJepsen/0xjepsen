### Hello, I'm 0xJepsen

I’m a computer scientist passionate about high impact technology. My research interests lay at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. I value work ethic and tenacity above all else.

- 🏦 I’m currently working on building financial derivatives from [RMMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14769.pdf).
- 🪷 I grew up off-the-grid in a Tibetan Budhist community for the first 13 years of my life. The lineage was the [Nyingma](https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Nyingma) school of thought. 

## Education

BS - Mathematics and Philosophy 

MS - Computer Science Advised By [Dr. Craig Partridge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f-E5nFEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
  - 🔎 Evaluated the performance of unique generator polynomials for cyclic error detection
  - 📦 Evaluated the performance of tropical algebraic models for TCP and identified key assumptions and produced theoretical improvments

I am currently studying for my Doctoral Degree under Dr [Amani Altarawneh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CfjaUOsAAAAJ&hl=en) investigating the economic activity in distributed ledgers.
