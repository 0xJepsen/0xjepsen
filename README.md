### Hello, I'm Waylon

I'm an engineer at the San Francisco Compute Company, building infrastructure 
for the GPU compute market.

My interests sit at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and 
philosophy. I grew up off-the-grid in a Tibetan Buddhist community for the 
first 13 years — the lineage was the Nyingma school of thought.

Previously: Founding Engineer at Pluto (applied cryptography, web proofs), 
Founding Research Engineer at Primitive (DeFi protocol design, Arbiter).

Some things I've done:
- Presented constant function market makers at DARPA as a DARPA Riser
- Received research grant from the Ethereum Foundation on algebraic hash 
  function security
- Reduced TLS session proof generation from 30 minutes to 30 seconds at Pluto
