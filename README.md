### Hello, I'm Jepsen

I’m a research engineer passionate about high-impact technology. My interests lie at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. I value curiosity, authenticity. I enjoy working with amazing people. I am interested in thoery of software and mind. Taking care of yourself is the most important thing you can do.

Some things about me:
- I grew up off-the-grid in a Tibetan Buddhist community for the first 13 years. The lineage was the [Nyingma](https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Nyingma) school of thought. 
- If you want to know my professional background, here is my [CV](Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)
